# 🐦 Switter - Decentralized Social Media PRD

## 🎯 Vision Statement

**"Twitter meets Web3" - The first truly decentralized social platform where your wallet IS your identity.**

Build the social layer for the entire Sui ecosystem, where content creators are rewarded, ownership is real, and social interactions create economic value.

## 🚀 The Web3 Social Revolution

### Core Innovation: Wallet-Native Social

- **Your Sui wallet = Your profile** (no emails, no usernames)
- **Your holdings = Your credibility** (portfolio as social proof)
- **Your activity = Your reputation** (on-chain behavior scoring)
- **Your content = Your assets** (posts as tokenizable content)

### Why Sui + Walrus Makes This Possible

- **True ownership** of social data via Sui objects
- **Decentralized storage** via Walrus (no AWS dependency)
- **Instant finality** for real-time social interactions
- **Gas efficiency** for micro-transactions (tips, likes, etc.)

## 💰 Revolutionary Business Model

### Revenue Streams

- **Premium features** ($5-25/month) - Analytics, advanced tools
- **Promoted content** (Pay SUI for visibility boost)
- **Creator monetization** (5% of creator earnings)
- **API licensing** ($0.001 per call for developers)
- **Verification services** ($100 for project verification)
- **Custom domains** ($50/year for switter.yourname.sui)

### Network Effects Engine

```
More wallets → More content → More value
More tips → More creators → Better content
More followers → More influence → More opportunities
More data → Better algorithms → More engagement
```
